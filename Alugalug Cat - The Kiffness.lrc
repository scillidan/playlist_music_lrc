[01:15.87] I am human and you're a cat
[01:21.05] We're making music, it's a matter of fact
[01:26.23] I hate to hear you scream out in fear
[01:31.74] But don't you worry for I am here
[01:36.40] 
[01:58.40] You keep singing sweet melodies
[02:03.88] What sometimes scares you, can set you free
[02:08.85] I know you're hurting deep down inside
[02:14.49] But in the darkness great things you'll find
[02:19.33]
